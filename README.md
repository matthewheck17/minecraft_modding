# minecraft_modding

This is a minecraft mod that I created. It adds in multiple blocks and items into the game.

Added blocks- white carpet block, black carpet block, concrete block

Added items- backpack, pencil, laptop

Note - In order to use this mod it must be added to the minecraft files, it cannot run by itself.
